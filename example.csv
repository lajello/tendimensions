1	Only a fully trained Jedi Knight, with The Force as his ally, will conquer Vader and his Emperor. If you end your training now, if you choose the quick and easy path, as Vader did, you will become an agent of evil
3	Well, in layman's terms, you use a rotating magnetic field to focus a narrow beam of gravitons; these in turn fold space-time consistent with Weyl tensor dynamics until the space-time curvature becomes infinitely large and you have a singularity
4	Since positronic signatures have only been known to emanate from androids such as myself, it is logical to theorize that there is an android such as myself on Kolarus III
5	Now if you don't want to be the fifth person ever to die in meta-shock from a planar rift, I suggest you get down behind that desk and don't move until we give you the signal
6	You can ask any price you want, but you must give me those letters
7	Right now you're in no position to ask questions! And your snide remarks
8	I want to thank you, sir, for giving me the opportunity to work
9	Frankie, you're a good old man, and you've been loyal to my Father for years...so I hope you can explain what you mean
10	And we drink to her, and we all congratulate her on her wonderful accomplishment during this last year...her great success in A Doll's House!
11	I'm trying to tell you – and this is where you have to trust me – but, I think your life might be in real danger
12	Mr. Lebowski is prepared to make a generous offer to you to act as courier once we get instructions for the money
13	Take the Holy Gospels in your hand and swear to tell the whole truth concerning everything you will be asked
14	I'm sorry, I just feel like... I know I shouldn't ask, I just need some kind of help, I just, I have a deadline tomorrow
15	Look, Dave, I know that you're sincere and that you're trying to do a competent job, and that you're trying to be helpful, but I can assure the problem is with the AO-units, and with your test gear
16	Well... listen, if you need any help, you know, back up, call me, OK?
17	I'm going to marry the woman I love
18	If you are truly wild at heart, you'll fight for your dreams... Don’t turn away from love, Sailor
19	You admit to me you do not love your fiance?
20	Hey, I know what I'm talkin' about, black women ain't the same as white women
21	That's how it was in the old world, Pop, but this is not Sicily
22	But, as you are so fond of observing, Doctor, I'm not human
23	It’s just funny...who needs a serial psycho in the woods with a chainsaw when we have ourselves
24	I do enjoy playing bingo, if you'd like to join me for a game tomorrow night at church you’re welcome to
25	Oh, I'm sure it’s a lot of fun, 'cause the Incas did it, you know, and-and they-they-they were a million laughs
26	Forgive me for askin', son, and I don’t mean to belabor the obvious, but why is it that you’ve got your head so far up your own ass?
27	If you're lying to me you poor excuse for a human being, I'm gonna blow your brains all over this car
28	I couldn't give a shit if you believe me or not, and frankly I'm too tired to prove it to you
